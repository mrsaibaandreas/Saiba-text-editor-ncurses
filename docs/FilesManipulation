1. File opening
    1.1 The files will be opened via the open() syscall. So for the open file, a file descriptor
    is returned

    e.g: int fd = open("file", <mode>, <flags>)

2. File reading    
    1.1 Based on the window size, the window.max_row lines from the file will be read via read()
        syscall
    
    1.2 The buffer will read in chuncks of 1kB  (subject to change) and display on the screen until
        the window.max_row line is read until EOL. By displaying, is meant mvwprintw.
    

3. File display
    3.1 wrefresh upon main_w.win is called 

4. Scrolling
    4.1 For scrolling only one line will be read until EOL.
    4.2 - Remove first line, add last line (maybe use a circular buffer ??? )
        - Update the row number pad from the left side
