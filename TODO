6. Create github repo (DONE)
7. Cleanup the code
8. Find a nicer method for display current position of variables onto the screen, it's hardcoded

BUG:
    When trying to read from a different window, escape characters are not interpreted.
    Check why, read ncurses implementation for special chars.
    RCA: Use of main_w before newwin is called for initialization
    Solution: Initialize the WINDOW before calling keypad upon it.
