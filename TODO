BUG:
    When trying to read from a different window, escape characters are not interpreted.
    Check why, read ncurses implementation for special chars.
    RCA: Use of main_w before newwin is called for initialization
    Solution: Initialize the WINDOW before calling keypad upon it. (Fixed 29.01.2026)
